<h3>Why App.Net Should be Acquired by the Wikimedia Foundation: Because a Billion Dollars Isn't Cool, You Know What is Though?</h3>
<p>Legend. As in being relevant to world. Silicon Valley is in danger of overcoming Wall Street on one of the worst possible metrics: Wealth Generated/ Global Relevance. The Instagram/ Wikipedia Ratio is the toxic Silcon Valley cousin to Wall Street's Debt/ Equity Ratio: and on that metric, its 2007 and the leveraged CDO squared is back in style from Cupertino to SOMA. There is no paucity of opportunity for a young 20 something, overeducated quantitative to make avarice-esque money at Goldman... err Github... but just as the invention of bottle service and bankerization killed off the shiny beacon of creativity that was the New York night scene of the 90's, the Cylon wars are ryhme like time themselves at Wall Street west. "Retired" twenty eight year olds  who retreat to their eccentricites after accumulating eight figure bank accounts: The market for accumulating wealth has been commoditized... as pedestrian as vapid hipster navel gazing of the "artistic enduring beauty" of the Golden Gate bridge or waxing on about the perfection of the simple. A capitalist truth is revealed, there is no glory in wealth left. But with every arbitraged market, comes a new opportunity: overlooked, underappreciate and as certain as the sun: THE NEXT BIG THING. The market for making difference is being priced in the bargain bin. </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9krpx5vqhwkak8u/ProxiVote%20Working%20Paper.pdf">ProxiCast: An Agent Based Algorithm and
Methods to Achieve Continous,
Asychronous Allocation of Franchise,<a></h2>
<p>In this paper we introduce ProxiCast. This Agent-Based Algorithm and Method toolkit makes it possible to for example, permit an electorate to vote on each matter that comes before its Representative Legislating body in real-time and with 100% participation rates. This type of Franchise Allocation has the properties of being Continuous, Asynchronous, and less vulnerable to traditional Principal-Agent, Moral Hazard, and Adverse Selection biases that affect prototypical Representative Democracy Structure. This paper outlines ProxiCast from an introductory Level, and gives a broad discussion of the advantages and challenges of such a system. </p>
