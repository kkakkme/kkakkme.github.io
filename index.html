<h3>Why App.Net Should be Acquired by the Wikimedia Foundation: Because a Billion Dollars Isn't Cool, You Know What is Though?</h3>
<h4>October 18, 2013</h4>
<p>Legend. As in being relevant to world. Silicon Valley is in danger of overcoming Wall Street on one of the worst possible metrics: Wealth Generated/ Global Relevance. The Instagram/ Wikipedia Ratio is the toxic Silcon Valley cousin to Wall Street's Debt/ Equity Ratio: and on that metric, its 2007 and the leveraged CDO squared is back in style from Cupertino to SOMA. There is no dearth of opportunity for a young 23 year old bro-grammer to make avarice-esque wealth 2.0, retire at twenty eight year and retreat to their eccentricites after accumulating eight figure bank accounts... but this reveals the naked truth: the market for accumulating wealth 2.0 has been commoditized... as pedestrian as vapid hipster ramblings of the enduring beauty of the Golden Gate bridge or waxings on about the perfection of the simple. There is neither glory nor novelty left in pursuit of dotcom (or dotnet) millions. However, as with every arbitraged market, comes a new opportunity: overlooked, underappreciate and as certain as the sun: THE NEXT BIG THING. The market for making difference is quietly being priced in the bargain bin. </p>
 <p>It is easy to fall for the great hope of APP.NET; at its core, it something both rare and universal, a big idea that carries the promise of freedom... until I logged on and realized APP.NET was JAPCSN (Just Another Private Corporate Social Network); just one with less uers and some inspirational branding. Having realized yet another dream was to be deferred, I comforted myself in the mindlessly awesome absorption of knowledge that is browsing on Wikipedia... and then it dawned on me, Wikiapp.net... the APP.NET dream realized.</p>
 <p>No more false promises, no more false prophets, just pure, genuine and free, freedom. For a moment, everything seemed right in the world. What I am proposing is a challenge to young innovators. If you want to matter, work on a big idea... and make it so big that its inevitable to be a basic human right a generation from now... like the right to your social map... and make it untouchable, sacrosanct and beyond the reach of corporate greed... a non-profit so you WIN! Wikiapp.net would have 1 billion users in 1 month... precisely because it would NOT be JAPCSN... It would the one ring to rule them all. GAME OVER FB, TWTR. Besides the a massive tax benefit for donating valuable shares, and recieving the highest compensation of any non-profit executive, young innovators "Wiki-Combinator-ifying" their pursuits would be on the fast track to achieving something only a handful of their for-profit bretherin are ever likely to: user trust leading to enduring global relevance... NOW THATS COOL. APP.NET could still charge for its services, or NOT! There is no price attributable to the value of being able to offer a service from the uniquely credible viewpoint a non profit like Wikimedia. Every company not named FB or TWTR would happily take a tax deduction and kill the evil emperors at the same time by donating liberally. And as for the desperate fundraising pleas of Jimmy Wales; what true now is if every tech and media decamillionaire gave $100k, there would be more than enough "innovation capital" to accelerate a dozen such ideas. Shame on every tech decamillionaire that doesn't already give generously to Wikipedia, you are cheating on your taxes and GOD is the IRS. Now if Wikiapp.NET were to become a reality, every hacker around the globe would shame you stingy tech scrooges into paying your dues forward by donating, before EVER returning your calls. So to APP.NET: don't waste this opportunity to buy when everyone else is selling... get LONG a shot at buying something priceless: the chance to be a LEGEND... while its still cheap...</p>

Methods to Achieve Continous,
Asychronous Allocation of Franchise,<a></h2>
<h4>October 15, 2013</h4>
<p>In this paper we introduce ProxiCast. This Agent-Based Algorithm and Method toolkit makes it possible to for example, permit an electorate to vote on each matter that comes before its Representative Legislating body in real-time and with 100% participation rates. This type of Franchise Allocation has the properties of being Continuous, Asynchronous, and less vulnerable to traditional Principal-Agent, Moral Hazard, and Adverse Selection biases that affect prototypical Representative Democracy Structure. This paper outlines ProxiCast from an introductory Level, and gives a broad discussion of the advantages and challenges of such a system. </p>
